# Monsieur Ouate's House Sale Project

## Description

This project was created as part of my high school. The initial goal was to develop a website for selling Monsieur Ouate's house. However, as the development progressed, I got a bit carried away, which led to the creation of many additional pages and unexpected features. The site evolved into a much more comprehensive platform than originally intended.

## Features

- **Home Page:** Presentation of the house with photos and sale details.
- **Presentation Pages:** Sections detailing the houseâ€™s features, history, and surrounding area.
- **Contact Page:** A form for potential buyers to get in touch.
- **Additional Section:** Other pages and features that emerged during the project development.

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_URL>
